<h3 style="color: #000;">A gentleman wanted for a lady who’s  sick and tired of dating apps, and the  men on them. </h3>
<hr>
<p>
The lady in question (let’s call her X) is a serial (and serious) entrepreneur. She’s in  her mid forties and has had to move house recently, because her laughs were too  loud. She has two dogs, two ears and a nose that can smell bullshit a mile away.  <br> <br>
X loves making cocktails, although truth be told, come evening, she likes to curl up  with her rum and a total quantity of 4 Lays chips because “calories”. And although  X is vegetarian, she’s been known to cook up a mean chicken curry (although  people have to work hard to find themselves a seat at her table).  <br> <br>
If your idea of romance is flowers and chocolates and teddy bears, you should  know, while X will welcome flowers once in a while, chocolates and teddy bears are  thrown in the bin. Her idea of romance is not the showy kind. It lies more in the  unspoken words and the little things that are difficult to put into words. But, she  may just lean towards a truly grand gesture. She is confusing like that. <br> <br>
X is childlike in many ways, and an ancient person on occasion. She’s witty,  extremely charming, has a particular fondness for animals (not the human kind),  tattoos, sunsets and the moon and come 50, she wants to retire on an island with  no name, far far away from here (or anywhere), and run a bar in the evenings.  Marriage, is not something X is looking for.  
What X is looking for, is a partner in crime honestly. Someone who ‘gets’ her.  Someone who’s (ideally) tall, well groomed (biting nails is a no-no), is a poster boy  for personal hygiene and driven, with a sense of purpose. The person should  (obviously), not be married or “hooked”, or looking for a casual fling, because X  has had many of those, and while they’re nice, this is not what she’s looking for  right now. The person should be warm in the way a friend is, passionate in the way  only a lover can be, and caring, because X’s tired of caring being a one-way street.
